ANNCR:	Some lawns have all the luck. Like lawns fed with fast-acting, long-lasting Scotts Turf Builder UltraFeed, exclusively at the Home Depot.  Safe for all grass types, one application quickly greens and keeps lawns fed up to 6 months, for a stronger, greener lawn all season.  That’s not luck. That’s brilliant.  It’s a good time to be a doer.  With long-lasting Scotts Turf Builder UltraFeed, available only at the Home Depot.    How doers get more done. 

LEGAL:	While supplies last. Selection varies by store.
