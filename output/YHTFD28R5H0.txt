ANNCR:	Every Saturday, you’ve been thinking cutting the grass would go a lot faster on a riding mower. 

The Home Depot agrees. Right now, the rugged Poulan Pro 42-inch riding lawn mower is a new lower price of just $999, you save $100. 

That comes with the engine power of a Briggs & Stratton, a 2 year-warranty and turn-on-a-dime 16” turning radius. 

Nice to have you back, Saturday.

Get the Poulan Pro riding lawn mower, just $999 bucks at The Home Depot. More Saving, more doing.

LEGAL: 	Offer valid until August 2nd. Available in select stores.
