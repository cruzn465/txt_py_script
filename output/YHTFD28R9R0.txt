VO:     	Starting a garden. It’s kinda like starting a family. You care for it, watch it grow, and if you get the right brand, like Bonnie Plants Harvest Select, you watch it grow a lot. You start to feel a real bond with your plant family. Just don’t name them, because they’re gonna be delicious. 

Get help donating your surplus to local food banks from The Home Depot and AmpleHarvest.org. It feels like spring at The Home Depot. 

How doers get more done.
