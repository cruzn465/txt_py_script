ANNCR:	Summer’s here. So is grilling season. Start ’em both at The Home Depot, where the Dyna-Glo 5-Burner Gas Grill with sear burner and smoker box is at a Special Buy of just 229 bucks.  It sports a fresh new look. A great matte-black finish, which, for a grill, is pretty cool. And its big cooking area covers plenty of steaks, burgers, and weekends.  Today is the day for doing. Red, White & Blue savings, now on the Dyna-Glo Gas Grill, only at The Home Depot. More saving. More doing.

LEGAL:	While supplies last.
