ANNC:	Only The Home Depot has the Weber Spirit two-burner gas grill with Gourmet Barbecue System. Just $399. And just in time for Fathers Day.  It’s one grill with infinite possibilities. Like a griddle insert to go from flipping burgers to flipping pancakes. And four other available inserts to take him where no grill has gone before.
 Not at this price.  Every dad deserves a Weber Spirit two-burner gas grill, just $399 and only at The Home Depot. More saving. More doing.
