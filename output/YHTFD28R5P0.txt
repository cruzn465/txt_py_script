ANNCR:	The Home Depot is not your garden-variety garden center. Not with the largest assortment of regionally selected live goods and landscape products.   Like big, quart-size Rio Dipledenia at a Special Buy, three for just 12 bucks, in red, pink or even raspberry. You can’t pick better flowers for Mother’s Day.
 Or a better price.  Today is the day for doing. Starting with a stop at the Garden Center of The Home Depot. More saving. More doing.

LEGAL:	Selection varies by store. Continental US only.
