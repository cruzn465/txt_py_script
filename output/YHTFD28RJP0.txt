ANNCR:	Spring is on its way. So are weeds. Plan ahead with Scotts Bonus S granular Southern Weed & Feed Fertilizer at The Home Depot.	
 Save 6 bucks for coverage up to 5,000 square feet. Save 12 bucks for 10,000 square-foot coverage. Kill weeds now, and thicken your lawn to crowd out future weeds. That’s a warm welcome for spring.  And a cold shoulder for weeds.  It’s a good time to be a doer. And for Scotts Bonus S, now at The Home Depot. How doers get more done.

LEGAL:	U.S. Only.  Selection varies by store.
