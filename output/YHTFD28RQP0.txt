ANNCR:	Weeds everywhere are shaking in their roots. Because now at The Home Depot, when you buy RoundUp Extended Control Weed & Grass Killer with Comfort Wand, you get a free refill.  Kill existing weeds down to the roots. See results in as little as 3 hours. And prevent new weeds for up to 4 months.  Oh, and that free refill? No wonder weeds are worried.  It’s a good time to be a doer. But not a weed. Thanks to RoundUp products, a free refill, and The Home Depot.   How doers get more done.
