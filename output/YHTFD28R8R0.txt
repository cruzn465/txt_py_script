VO:		What makes mulch so loveable? The texture? The smell? 
Well, it’s not just people that love mulch. Your plants do, too. .  	Retaining moisture and regulating soil temps - it’s the whole  	package. And when you use Scotts Earthgro or exclusive Vigoro wood  	mulches, you can even pick the color.

What’s not to love? Stop in	for mulch and everything else you need this season. It feels like spring at The Home Depot. 	
How doers get more done.
